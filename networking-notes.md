- TCP vs UDP

## Protocols
- DNS – domain name resolution
- HTTP/HTTPS – web communication
- ICMP – network diagnostics

## Security Relevance
- Understanding how data flows helps identify attack points
- Packet inspection is useful in traffic analysis
- Networking knowledge is essential for web application security testing

## Tools Used
- Wireshark (basic packet analysis)
- Nmap (introductory understanding)
