- Identified trust boundaries in web apps
- Learned where application security vulnerabilities originate

## HTTP Fundamentals (Security Perspective)

- Understood HTTP request/response structure
- Analyzed HTTP methods and their security impact
- Studied headers, cookies, and status codes
- Learned why HTTPS does not prevent application-layer vulnerabilities

## Authentication vs Authorization

- Clearly differentiated authentication and authorization
- Studied common authentication failures
- Analyzed authorization flaws such as IDOR and role bypass

## Same-Origin Policy (SOP)

- Studied browser-enforced Same-Origin Policy
- Understood what SOP blocks and what it allows
- Differentiated SOP from CORS
- Analyzed SOP relevance to XSS, CSRF, and API security

# Attack Surface Mapping (Web Applications)

- Practiced end-to-end web request analysis
- Identified user-controlled inputs and trust boundaries
